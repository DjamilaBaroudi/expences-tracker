# Expenses Tracker

Expenses Tracker is a simple sample project designed to help you practice your React and TypeScript skills. It provides a basic interface for entering and tracking expense items. The project utilizes the Shadcdn template, which incorporates Tailwind CSS and dark mode capabilities through `next-themes`. Additionally, the template includes features such as Tailwind CSS class sorting, merging, and linting for cleaner and more maintainable code.

The project is created using the [shadcn-ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui). The components of the UI are accessible and customizable, providing a set of ready-to-use elements that can be easily integrated into applications. 


## Features

- **Expense Entry**: Users can easily enter new expense items with a title (name of the expense), date, and price.

- **List Format**: The entered expense items are displayed in a list format, providing an organized view of expenses.

- **Columns Format**: Expenses can also be viewed in a columns format, offering an alternative layout for better visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The styling is accomplished using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes designing responsive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces more straightforward.

- **next-themes**: The integration of `next-themes` allows for the implementation of dark mode functionality with ease.
